# Overview

The map software I created utilizes the ArcGIS API for JavaScript to generate an interactive map with custom markers and animations. The purpose of this software is to provide users with an enjoyable experience while exploring different points of interest on the map.

The source of the data used for this software is a set of sample marker data I manually created for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, the data could be obtained from various public sources or APIs that provide geographic information for different points of interest.

I developed this software with the aim of honing my GIS programming skills and exploring the capabilities of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Additionally, I wanted to showcase how custom icons, animations, and interactive elements can be incorporated to make map exploration more fun and enjoyable for users.
